There is no limit on the number of Channels you can have available at any one time, and you can freely switch between them on a per-device basis.</p><p>To access Channels, select Channels from the homepage, or click Channels in the top right of the interface.</p><p><img src="channel.2b35f156.png" alt="channel"></p><p>A channel consists of a Name and Layout. The channel&#39;s name will be used to refer to it throughout the interface, but will never be displayed on the actual device when it is being cast. The channel&#39;s layout allows one or more URLs to be embedded (via iframe) into the page that will be cast. Two layouts are provided, though creating additional layouts is not especially difficult (see <a href="#creating-layouts">Creating Layouts</a>).</p><h3 id="devices">Devices</h3><p><img src="devices.ae09e66f.png" alt="devices"></p><p>Chromecast devices are now interfaced with as mDNS devices via the new <a href="https://github.com/thibauts/node-castv2">Castv2 API</a>. This removes the Chrome/Chromium browser restriction that previously existed with Chromecast devices, and even allows Multicast to be run remotely from a headless server (see <a href="#setup">Setup</a>).</p><p>All Chromecast devices on the same network as the host will display here. Devices can be <em>registered</em> to be activated as Multicast receivers and assigned a channel, receive push alerts, and so on.</p><p>To register a device, click on the device&#39;s name or click Register Chromecast.</p><p><img src="register.c3582c16.png" alt="register"></p><p>A device&#39;s name will be whatever the Chromecast&#39;s name was when it was set up. A device&#39;s Location can be set to anything you would like to clarify where it is located. Make sure to choose something descriptive, as this will make Channel management easier down the line.</p><p>You can choose not to select a Channel when registering a device - doing so will leave the device on the default registration screen until a Channel is selected.</p><p><img src="device.242ccc9c.png" alt="device"></p><p>Once a device has been registered, you can select its name from the Devices list to change the Channel it is displaying, refresh its Channel content, or Reconnect it if loses connection.</p><h3 id="push-alerts">Push Alerts</h3><p><img src="push.bfc477c0.png" alt="push"></p><p>Push Alerts are useful for displaying small pieces of information to all receiver devices. Alerts will begin displaying on all connected receivers as soon as they are created, and will continue to display until their set duration is reached or the receiver is reset.</p><h3 id="channel-takeover">Channel Takeover</h3><p><img src="takeover.5d3a6d1f.png" alt="takeover"></p><p>A Channel Takeover allows all receiver devices to be temporarily, indefinitely redirected to a single channel. A Takeover will begin immediately after it is started, and will last until it is manually stopped from the homepage.</p><p><em>*Takeovers will also affect devices that are registered after they have begun.</em></p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>This project requires Node.js and NPM (bundled with Node), as well as a MongoDB server. Since Node is cross-platform, it should work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p><p>This project depends on <a href="https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns">node_mdns</a>, which in turn requires a mDNS stack. Follow the installation instructions <a href="https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns#installation">here</a> for whichever platform you are on to install a mDNS stack. If you&#39;re on Linux, this is as simple as</p><h4 id="debian-ubuntu">Debian/Ubuntu</h4><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo apt-get install build-essential libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev</code></pre><h4 id="redhat-fedora-centos">RedHat/Fedora/CentOS</h4><pre><code class="language-shell">sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ avahi avahi-compat-libdns_sd avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel nss_mdns</code></pre><h3 id="setup">Setup</h3><p>If you don&#39;t already have access to a MongoDB server installation, follow the guide <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/">here</a>.</p><p>Grab the latest stable copy of Node/NPM from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a> or install it via <a href="http://nvm.sh">nvm</a>.</p><p>In order to access the Chromecast API, you need to <a href="https://cast.google.com/publish/">register as a Cast developer</a> (it costs $5).</p><p>Once you&#39;ve done this, log in to the <a href="https://cast.google.com/u/1/publish/#/overview">Cast Developer SDK Console</a> and click <strong>Add New Application</strong>. Choose <strong>Custom Receiver</strong>, then name it <code>Multicast</code> and set the <strong>Receiver Application URL</strong> to <code>http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3944/landing</code>. Disable <strong>Guest Mode</strong> and then <strong>Save</strong>.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to use your LAN IP here (192.168.1.xx or similar), not your WAN/external IP. This should resolve to your server only within your local network.</p><p>You now need to register your Chromecast devices as developer devices. For each device, locate the Serial Number (located on the back of the device and on the box), click <strong>Add New Device</strong>, and enter the Serial Number and a brief Description. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: This may take up to 15 minutes to take effect. Go grab a cup of coffee and then head back.)</p><p>Installation is a snap with NPM.</p><pre><code class="language-shell">npm i multicast -g

Refer to the existing rules for inspiration.</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Channel sections are currently limited to 4 per channel. To increase this, change <code>maxSectionCount</code> on <code>app/views/channel.pug</code>. </p><p><strong>CSS Icon Design</strong></p><p>In <code>app/views/channel.pug</code>, add a div under <code>#channel-layout</code> with the class <code>layout</code> and <code><em>layout-name</em></code>, again replacing <em>layout-name</em> with your layout name. Make sure this div has the class <code>active</code> when the channel is using your layout, as such:</p><pre><code>.layout.<em>layout-name</em>(class=(channel && channel.layout == '<em>layout-name</em>' ? 'active' : ''))</code></pre><p>Style this div in <code>build/css/channel-edit.css</code> to conform to the existing channel layouts:</p><pre><code class="language-css">width: 250px;
height: 150px;
border: 1px solid rgb(202, 206, 215);</code></pre><p>Once you finish, don&#39;t forget to <code>gulp</code> everything to apply your new layout.</p><h2 id="license">License</h2><p>This project is licensed under the MIT License - see <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a> for more details.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/groupon/greenscreen">Greenscreen</a> and the team over at Groupon for inspiring this product.</p>
